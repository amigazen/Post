PostScript band printing driver (PostBand, with Post V1.3)
==========================================================

Copyright Adrian Aylward 1990.

You may freely copy, use and modify this program (postband).  The source is
included in the distribution.

The program calls the PostScript interpreter library to render a file to the
printer in a series of bands.  It can therefore be run on machines with
insufficient memory for a full page buffer; it should be possible to run
it on a 1 megabyte machine.  Since it has to rerun the interpreter for each
band it is going to be several times slower than printing directly.  It also
depends upon the file being conformant to the PostScript structuring
programs.

Usage
=====

    postband [files...] PRINT file [SIZE xyod..s..p.bc.] [MEM fhlv..]

The "files..." are the startup files for Post.  Usually this will be the
standard startup "init.ps".

The PRINT option is the name of the PostScript source file to be printed.

The SIZE and MEM options are passed directly to Post.  Up to 5 of each are
allowed; later values override earlier values.  See the file post.doc for
details.

Since the default for the SIZE option is to render the entire page at once
you will in practice always need to supply this option.  You are
recommended to experiment until you find a suitable set of values and then
create a shell script for them.  As a starting point for a 1 megabyte
machine, try:

    postband init.ps print ... size s480 mem v150000f30000l30000h5000

The exact amount of memory you have available depends on how many disks
you have, and how many programs you have resident etc..  N.B. as PostBand
copies the print file to a temporary file in the t: directory, it is
probably a good idea to make sure t: is assigned to a disk and not a ram
drive.

The default value for the VM size is 280000, as for earlier versions of
Post, not 600000.

N.B. the aspect of the printer dump is always horizontal.

File structuring
================

The PostScript file structuring conventions basically assume that a program
consists of a prologue that is executed once at the beginning, and a series
of pages that can be executed independently - saving and restoring the vm.

All PostBand is looking for is simply the comments dividing the sections.

The first line must begin:

    %!PS-Adobe-

Then follows the prologue.  Each page begins:

    %%Page:

At the end of the file is the trailer, which begins:

    %%Trailer:

N.B. EPSF files, such as demos and clip art, do not fit this structure.
But since they only contain a single "page" you can run the entire file
once for each band; or if you prefer simply edit in the required "%%Page:".
