PostScript LaserJet printing driver (PostLJ, with Post V1.7)
============================================================

Copyright Adrian Aylward 1990, 1992.

You may freely copy, use and modify this program (postlj).  The source is
included in the distribution.

The program calls the PostScript interpreter library to render a series of
PostScript files to a LaserJet printer connected to the parallel port.  It
supports all the possible page sizes, in portrait or landscape orientation.

It is designed to run on a LaserJet II, or IIP/III etc., and also on a
DeskJet. It will likely also work on LaserJet emulations.

It is run from the CLI command line. There is no workbench startup.

The CLI interface is very simple.  No attempt has been made to provide fancy
keywords for the options; if you can't remember them write yourself a script.

There are no status checks on the printer device, so if the output hangs
check that your printer is plugged in and switched on.  Is is advisable
to switch the printer on before starting, otherwise the first few characters
may be lost, and the printout corrupted.

Usage
=====

    postlj -options [files...] [TO tofile] [MEM fhlv..]

The options are indicated by an initial "-".  They are single letters,
followed by a numeric value.

    -sn      Page size     (Default: A4)
                 0   Letter
                 1   Legal
                 2   Executive
                 3   A4
                 4   COM10
                 5   Monarch
                 6   C5
                 7   DL
    -an      Aspect        (Default: vertical)
                 0   vertical
                 1   horizontal
    -jn      Model         (Default: LasetJet IIP, III, IIIP, IIIsi)
                 0   DeskJet
                 1   LaserJet II
                 2   LaserJet IIP, III, IIIP, IIIsi etc.
    -gn      Graphics compression
                 0   Off
                 1   On
    -bnnnn   Page number to begin printing at
    -ennnn   Page number to end printing after
    -cnn     Number of copies
    -xnnnnn  Paper x size, in dots (300 per inch)
    -ynnnnn  Paper y size
    -lnnnnn  Left  margin, in dots
    -rnnnnn  Right margin
    -unnnnn  Upper margin, in dots
    -dnnnnn  Lower margin
    -hnnnnn  Horizontal offset registration, in dots
    -vnnnnn  Vertical   offset registration

The "files..." are the PostScript files to be interpreted.  Usually these
will be the standard startup "psfonts:init.ps" followed by the file you
wish to print.

The TO filename defaults to "par:" the parallel device handler.  You can
specify an alternative name if you want to save the output in a file, or
send it to a different handler.

The MEM options are passed directly to Post.  Up to 5 are allowed; later
values override earlier values.  See the file post.doc for details.

LaserJet models
---------------

Earlier LaserJets, notably the model II, had a slightly smaller imaging area
than newer models, such as the IIP, III, IIIP, IIIsi. They also lacked the
offset registration facility. If you have a LaserJet clone you may need to
experiment to see which value of the -j option works best. (N.B. this has
nothing to do with whether the printer supports PCL4 or PCL5). All newer
HP laser printers ought to be at least as capable as the IIP.

From the IIP onwards, LaserJets support compression of bitmapped graphics.
This considerably reduces the amount of data that has to be passed through
the printer's parallel port, making printing much faster. The graphics
compression option is automatically set if you use the -j2 option. If
however you printer is a clone which looks like a IIP but does not support
compression you will need to turn compression off. Otherwise your printer
will likely hang or print garbage, possibly many pages thereof.

DeskJets are a little different, in that margins are fixed at 0.5 inches,
or 150 dots. They are also restricted to vertical aspect only, though you
could print lanbdscape by adjusting your PostScript code.

Page sizes
----------

If you are using one of the standard page sizes then just set the size
using the -s option, there is no need to supply the x and y values as they
are built in to the code.

If however you want to use a custom paper size then you should specify its
dimensions using the -x and -y options. Then the poscript interpreter can
know the actual size of the paper you are using. You should also set the -s
option to a page size at least as great as the paper you are actually using.
Otherwise your LaserJet might refuse to print off the edge of where it
thinks the paper ought to be. The default (A4) should usually be OK, unless
your paper is large, when you might need Legal (8.5 by 14 inches). Values
are in dots, and there are 300 of them to an inch.

The paper margins are set automatically, so you will not usually need to
set the -l, -r, -u, or -d options. The driver sets these to the limits of
the printable area as per the LaserJet technical manual. The PostScript
interpreter then uses these values to set up its initial clip path. You
will only need to change these values if you have a non-standard printer
or you want to adjust the location of the clip path. Values are in dots,
defaults according to the printer.

If you have a LaserJet IIP or III etc. you can use the -h anv -v options to
adjust the exact registration of the print image on the page. (The LaserJet
manual suggests this may be useful to allow for binding. Or it may be that
the paper path in you printer is not exactly aligned.) Values are in dots,
defaults the same as to the left and upper margins. Lower values move the
image to the left and top. There is no provision for values smaller than zero.

Examples
--------

Print a document on a LaserJet IIP, III etc. on A4 paper:

    postlj psfonts:init.ps doc.ps

Print pages 10 through 15 (inclusive) on a LaserJet IIP, III etc. connected
to the serial port:

    postlj -b10e15 psfonts:init.ps doc.ps to ser:

Print a picture on a LaserJet II on letter paper in landscape format:

    postlj -j1 -s0 a1 psfonts:init.ps picture.ps

Print a letter on a LaserJet IIP, III etc. on 9 by 7 inch paper:

    postlj -x2100y2400 psfonts:init.ps letter.ps

Print a letter on a DeskJet on letter paper

    postlj -j0 -s0 psfonts:init.ps letter.ps

Once you have worked out the right options for you favourite paper size,
write a shell script so you don't need to remember them again.
