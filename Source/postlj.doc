PostScript LaserJet printing driver (PostLJ, with Post V1.4)
============================================================

Copyright Adrian Aylward 1990, 1991.

You may freely copy, use and modify this program (postlj).  The source is
included in the distribution.

The program calls the PostScript interpreter library to render a series of
PostScript files to LaserJet printer connected to the parallel port.  It
supports all the possible page sizes, i portrait or landscape orientation.

It has been tested on a LaserJet IIP.  It will likely work with the other
current models in the LaserJet family or emulations thereof.

It is run from the CLI command line. There is no workbench startup.

The CLI interface is very simple.  No attempt has been made to provide fancy
keywords for the options; if you can't remember them write yourself a script.

There are no status checks on the printer device, so it the output hangs
check that your printer is plugged in and switched on.  Is is advisable
to switch the printer on before starting, otherwise the first few characters
may be lost, and the printout corrupted.

Usage
=====

    postband [-options ...] [files...] [TO tofile] [MEM fhlv..]

The filename defaults to "par:" the parallel device handler.  You can specify
an alternative name if you want to save the output in a file, or send it to
a different handler.

The options are indicated by an initial "-".  They are single letters,
followed by a numeric value.

    page size
        s0   legal
        s1   letter
        s2   executive
       *s3   A4  (default)
        s4   COM-10
        s5   monarch
        s6   C5
        s7   DL

    page orientation
       *l0   portrait  (default)
        l1   landscape

    begin printing at page number
       *b0   all pages
        b999 any value from 1 to 9999

    end printing at page number
       *e0   all pages
        e999 any value from 1 to 9999

    number of copies
       *n0   use #copies, or 1 if zero or more than 99 (default).
        n99  any value from 1 to 99

    graphics compression
        c0   disabled
        c1   enabled  (default)

    If you have an earlier model LaserJet that does not support graphics
    compression (the model II, I think) you must disable it.

The "files..." are the PostScript files to be interpreted.  Usually these
will be the standard startup "init.ps" followed the by file you wish to
print.

The TO filename defaults to "par:" the parallel device handler.  You can
specify an alternative name if you want to save the output in a file, or
send it to a different handler.

The MEM options are passed directly to Post.  Up to 5 are allowed; later
values override earlier values.  See the file post.doc for details.

For example, to print pages 10 through 15 (inclusive) of a document on
a LaserJet connected to the serial port, in letter format, landscape
orientation:

    postlj -s1 -l1 -b10e15 init.ps doc.ps to ser:
